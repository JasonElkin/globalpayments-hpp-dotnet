# Global Payments HPP .NET 

A  small .NET (Framework) library for creating the JSON used by the [JavaScript HPP SDK](https://github.com/globalpayments/rxp-js) and for parsing the subsequent requests as per the [documentation](https://developer.globalpay.com/#!/hpp/getting-started).

### This is <u>*not*</u> the official .NET SDK. 

You should take a look the [official .NET SDK](https://github.com/globalpayments/dotnet-sdk) first and make sure that's not a better fit for you.

### So why is this a thing?

Firstly, history. This library started out before the official .NET SDK existed and was reverse engineered from the old PHP SDK.

Secondly, compatibility. The official .NET SDK has some dependencies that we can't use in certain projects at Semantic.
